## Overview

This SDK provides a set of components for JavaScript applications to allow capturing of identity documents and face photos/videos for the purpose of identity verification. The SDK offers a number of benefits to help you create the best onboarding / identity verification experience for your customers:

- Carefully designed UI to guide your customers through the entire photo/video-capturing process
- Modular design to help you seamlessly integrate the photo/video-capturing process into your application flow
- Advanced image quality detection technology to ensure the quality of the captured images meets the requirement of the Onfido identity verification process, guaranteeing the best success rate
- Direct image upload to the Onfido service, to simplify integration\*

Note: the SDK is only responsible for capturing photos/videos. You still need to access the [Onfido API](https://documentation.onfido.com/) to manage applicants and checks.

Users will be prompted to upload a file containing an image of their document. On handheld devices they can also use the native camera to take a photo of their document.

Face step allows users to use their device cameras to capture their face using photos or videos.

## Getting started

### 1. Obtaining an API token

In order to start integration, you will need the **API token**. You can use our [sandbox](https://documentation.onfido.com/#sandbox-testing) environment to test your integration, and you will find the sandbox token inside your [Onfido Dashboard](https://onfido.com/dashboard/api/tokens).

#### 1.1 Regions

Onfido offers region-specific environments. Refer to the [Regions](https://documentation.onfido.com/#regions) section in the API documentation for token format and API base URL information.

### 2. Creating an applicant

With your API token, you should create an applicant by making a request to the [create applicant endpoint](https://documentation.onfido.com/#create-applicant) from your server:

```shell
$ curl https://api.onfido.com/v3/applicants \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_TOKEN' \
  -d 'first_name=John' \
  -d 'last_name=Smith'
```

Note: If you are currently using API `v2` please refer to [this migration guide](https://developers.onfido.com/guide/api-v2-to-v3-migration-guide) for more information.

You will receive a response containing the applicant id which will be used to create a JSON Web Token.

### 3. Generating an SDK token

For security reasons, instead of using the API token directly in you client-side code, you will need to generate and include a short-lived JSON Web Token ([JWT](https://jwt.io/)) every time you initialise the SDK. To generate an SDK Token you should perform a request to the [SDK Token endpoint](https://documentation.onfido.com/#generate-web-sdk-token) in the Onfido API:

```shell
$ curl https://api.onfido.com/v3/sdk_token \
  -H 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_TOKEN' \
  -F 'applicant_id=YOUR_APPLICANT_ID' \
  -F 'referrer=REFERRER_PATTERN'
```

Note: If you are currently using API `v2` please refer to [this migration guide](https://developers.onfido.com/guide/api-v2-to-v3-migration-guide) for more information.

Make a note of the `token` value in the response, as you will need it later on when initialising the SDK.

\* Tokens expire 90 minutes after creation.

### Cross device URL

This is a premium enterprise feature that must be enabled for your account before it can be used. Once enabled you will be able to specify your own custom url that the cross-device flow will redirect to instead of the Onfido default. To use this feature generate a SDK token as shown below and use it to start the SDK. For more information, please contact your Onfido Solution Engineer or Customer Success Manager.

```shell
$ curl https://api.onfido.com/v3/sdk_token \
 -H 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_TOKEN' \
 -F 'applicant_id=YOUR_APPLICANT_ID' \
 -F 'referrer=REFERRER_PATTERN' \
 -F 'cross_device_url=YOUR_CUSTOM_URL'
```

### 4. Including/Importing the library

#### 4.1 HTML Script Tag Include

Include it as a regular script tag on your page:

```html
<script src="dist/onfido.min.js"></script>
```

And the CSS styles:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/style.css" />
```

#### Example app

[JSFiddle example here.](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/onfido/onfido-sdk-ui/tree/master/demo/fiddle/)
Simple example using script tags.

#### 4.2 NPM style import

You can also import it as a module into your own JS build system (tested with Webpack).

```sh
$ npm install --save onfido-sdk-ui
```

```js
// ES6 module import
import { init } from 'onfido-sdk-ui'

// commonjs style require
var Onfido = require('onfido-sdk-ui')
```

The **CSS style** will be included **inline with the JS code** when the library is imported.

#### Notice

The library is **Browser only**, it does not support the **Node Context**.

#### Example App

**[Webpack Sample App repository here](https://github.com/onfido/onfido-sdk-web-sample-app/).**
Example app which uses the npm style of import.

### 5. Adding basic HTML markup

There is only one element required in your HTML, an empty element for the modal interface to mount itself on:

```html
<!-- At the bottom of your page, you need an empty element where the
verification component will be mounted. -->
<div id="onfido-mount"></div>
```

### 6. Initialising the SDK

You are now ready to initialise the SDK:

```js
Onfido.init({
  // the JWT token that you generated earlier on
  token: 'YOUR_JWT_TOKEN',
  // ID of the element you want to mount the component on
  containerId: 'onfido-mount',
  // ALTERNATIVE: if your integration requires it, you can pass in the container element instead
  // (Note that if `containerEl` is provided, then `containerId` will be ignored)
  containerEl: <div id="root" />,
  onComplete: function (data) {
    console.log('everything is complete')
    // `data` will be an object that looks something like this:
    //
    // {
    //   "document_front": {
    //     "id": "5c7b8461-0e31-4161-9b21-34b1d35dde61",
    //     "type": "passport",
    //     "side": "front"
    //   },
    //   "face": {
    //     "id": "0af77131-fd71-4221-a7c1-781f22aacd01",
    //     "variant": "standard"
    //   }
    // }
    //
    // For two-sided documents like `driving_licence` and `national_identity_card`, the object will also
    // contain a `document_back` property representing the reverse side:
    //
    // {
    //   ...
    //   "document_back": {
    //     "id": "6f63bfff-066e-4152-8024-3427c5fbf45d",
    //     "type": "driving_licence",
    //     "side": "back"
    // }
    //
    // You can now trigger your backend to start a new check
    // `data.face.variant` will return the variant used for the face step
    // this can be used to perform a facial similarity check on the applicant
  },
})
```

Congratulations! You have successfully started the flow. Carry on reading the next sections to learn how to:

- Handle callbacks
- Remove the SDK from the page
- Customise the SDK
- Create checks

## Handling callbacks

- **`onComplete {Function} optional`**

  Callback that fires when both the document and face have successfully been captured and uploaded.
  At this point you can trigger your backend to create a check by making a request to the Onfido API [create check endpoint](https://documentation.onfido.com/#create-check).
  The callback returns an object with the `variant` used for the face capture. The variant can be used to initiate a `facial_similarity_photo` or a `facial_similarity_video` check. The data will be formatted as follows: `{face: {variant: 'standard' | 'video'}}`.

  Here is an `onComplete` callback example:

  ```js
  Onfido.init({
    token: 'your-jwt-token',
    containerId: 'onfido-mount',
    onComplete: function (data) {
      console.log('everything is complete')
      // tell your backend service that it can create the check
      // when creating a facial similarity check, you can specify
      // whether you want to start a `facial_similarity_photo` check
      // or a `facial_similarity_video` check based on the value within `data.face.variant`
    },
  })
  ```

  Based on the applicant id, you can then create a check for the user via your backend.

- **`onError {Function} optional`**

  Callback that fires when one an error occurs. The callback returns the following errors types:

  - `exception`
    This type will be returned for the following errors:

    - Timeout and server errors
    - Authorization
    - Invalid token

    The data returned by this type of error should be used for debugging purpose.

  - `expired_token`
    This error will be returned when a token is expired. This error type can be used to provide a new token at runtime.

  Here is an example of the data returned by the `onError` callback:

  ```js
  // Example of data returned for an `exception` error type
  {
    type: "exception",
    message: "The request could not be understood by the server, please check your request is correctly formatted"
  }

  // Example of data returned for an `expired_token` error type
  {
    type: "expired_token",
    message: "The token has expired, please request a new one"
  }
  ```

- **`onModalRequestClose {Function} optional`**

  Callback that fires when the user attempts to close the modal.
  It is your responsibility to decide then to close the modal or not
  by changing the property `isModalOpen`.

## Removing the SDK

If you are embedding the SDK inside a single page app, you can call the `tearDown` function to remove the SDK completely from the current webpage. It will reset state and you can safely re-initialise the SDK inside the same webpage later on.

```javascript
onfidoOut = Onfido.init({...})
...
onfidoOut.tearDown()
```

## Customising the SDK

A number of options are available to allow you to customise the SDK:

- **`token {String} required`**

  A JWT is required in order to authorise with our WebSocket endpoint. If one isn’t present, an exception will be thrown.

- **`useModal {Boolean} optional`**

  Turns the SDK into a modal, which fades the background and puts the SDK into a contained box.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  <script>
      var onfido = {}

      function triggerOnfido() {
        onfido = Onfido.init({
          useModal: true,
          isModalOpen: true,
          onModalRequestClose: function() {
            // Update options with the state of the modal
            onfido.setOptions({isModalOpen: false})
          },
          token: 'token',
          onComplete: function(data) {
            // callback for when everything is complete
            console.log("everything is complete")
          }
        });
      };
  </script>

  <body>
    <!-- Use a button to trigger the Onfido SDK  -->
    <button onClick="triggerOnfido()">Verify identity</button>
    <div id='onfido-mount'></div>
  </body>
  ```

- **`isModalOpen {Boolean} optional`**

  In case `useModal` is set to `true`, this defines whether the modal is open or closed.
  To change the state of the modal after calling `init()` you need to later use `setOptions()` to modify it.
  The default value is `false`.

- **`shouldCloseOnOverlayClick {Boolean} optional`**

  In case `useModal` is set to `true`, the user by default can close the SDK by clicking on the close button or on the background overlay. You can disable the user from closing the SDK on background overlay click by setting the `shouldCloseOnOverlayClick` to false.

- **`containerId {String} optional`**

  A string of the ID of the container element that the UI will mount to. This needs to be an empty element. The default ID is `onfido-mount`. If your integration needs to pass the container element itself, use `containerEl` as described next.

- **`containerEl {Element} optional`**

  The container element that the UI will mount to. This needs to be an empty element. This can be used as an alternative to passing in the container ID string previously described for `containerId`. Note that if `containerEl` is provided, then `containerId` will be ignored.

- **`language {String || Object} optional`**
  The SDK language can be customised by passing a String or an Object. At the moment, we support and maintain translations for English (default), Spanish, German and French using respectively the following locale tags: `en_US`, `es_ES`, `de_DE`, `fr_FR`.
  To leverage one of these languages, the `language` option should be passed as a string containing a supported language tag.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  language: 'es_ES' | 'es'
  ```

  The SDK can also be displayed in a custom language by passing an object containing the locale tag and the custom phrases.
  The object should include the following keys:

  - `locale`: A locale tag. This is **required** when providing phrases for an unsupported language.
    You can also use this to partially customise the strings of a supported language (e.g. Spanish), by passing a supported language locale tag (e.g. `es_ES`). For missing keys, the values will be displayed in the language specified within the locale tag if supported, otherwise they will be displayed in English.
    The locale tag is also used to override the language of the SMS body for the cross device feature. This feature is owned by Onfido and is currently only supporting English, Spanish, French and German.

  - `phrases` (required) : An object containing the keys you want to override and the new values. The keys can be found in [`src/locales/en_US/en_US.json`](src/locales/en_US/en_US.json). They can be passed as a nested object or as a string using the dot notation for nested values. See the examples below.
  - `mobilePhrases` (optional) : An object containing the keys you want to override and the new values. The values specified within this object are only visible on mobile devices. Please refer to the `mobilePhrases` property in [`src/locales/en_US/en_US.json`](src/locales/en_US/en_US.json). **Note**: support for standalone `mobilePhrases` key will be deprecated soon. Consider nesting it inside `phrases` if applicable.

  ```javascript
  language: {
    locale: 'en_US',
    phrases: { welcome: { title: 'My custom title' } },
    mobilePhrases: {
      'capture.driving_licence.instructions': 'This string will only appear on mobile'
    }
  }
  ```

  If `language` is not present the default copy will be in English.

- **`smsNumberCountryCode {String} optional`**
  The default country for the SMS number input can be customised by passing the `smsNumberCountryCode` option when the SDK is initialised. The value should be a 2-characters long ISO Country code string. If empty, the SMS number country code will default to `GB`.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  smsNumberCountryCode: 'US'
  ```

- **`userDetails {Object} optional`**
  Some user details can be specified ahead of time, so that the user doesn't need to fill them in themselves.

  The following details can be used by the SDK:

  - `smsNumber` (optional) : The user's mobile number, which can be used for sending any SMS messages to the user. An example SMS message sent by the SDK is when a user requests to use their mobile devices to take photos. This should be formatted as a string, with a country code (e.g. `"+447500123456"`)

  ```javascript
  userDetails: {
    smsNumber: '+447500123456'
  }
  ```

- **`steps {List} optional`**

  List of the different steps and their custom options. Each step can either be specified as a string (when no customisation is required) or an object (when customisation is required):

  ```javascript
  steps: [
    {
      type: 'welcome',
      options: {
        title: 'Open your new bank account',
      },
    },
    'document',
    'face',
  ]
  ```

  In the example above, the SDK flow is consisted of three steps: `welcome`, `document` and `face`. Note that the `title` option of the `welcome` step is being overridden, while the other steps are not being customised.

  The SDK can also be used to capture Proof of Address documents. This can be achieved by using the `poa` step.

  Below are descriptions of the steps and the custom options that you can specify inside the `options` property. Unless overridden, the default option values will be used:

  ### welcome

  This is the introduction screen of the SDK. Use this to explain to your users that they need to supply identity documents (and face photos/videos) to have their identities verified.

  The custom options are:

  - `title` (string)
  - `descriptions` ([string])
  - `nextButton` (string)

  ### document

  This is the identity document capture step. Users will be asked to select the document type and to provide images of their selected document. For driving licence and national ID card types, the user will be able to see and select the document's issuing country from a list of supported countries. They will also have a chance to check the quality of the image(s) before confirming.

  The custom options are:

  - `documentTypes` (object)

    The list of document types visible to the user can be filtered by using the `documentTypes` option. The default value for each document type is `true`. If `documentTypes` only includes one document type, users will not see either the document selection screen or the country selection screen and instead will be taken to the capture screen directly.

    #### Configuring Country

    The `country` configuration for a document type allows you to specify the issuing country of the document with a 3-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code. Users will not see the country selection screen if this is set for a document type.

    **Note**: You can set the country for all document types except **Passport**.

    For example, if you would like to set the country as Spain (ESP) and skip the country selection screen for the driving licence document type only:

    ```json
    {
      "steps": [
        "welcome",
        {
          "type": "document",
          "options": {
            "documentTypes": {
              "driving_licence": {
                "country": "ESP"
              },
              "national_identity_card": true,
              "residence_permit": true
            }
          }
        },
        "complete"
      ]
    }
    ```

    If you would like to suppress the country selection screen for driving licence but do not want to set a country:

    ```json
    {
      "steps": [
        "welcome",
        {
          "type": "document",
          "options": {
            "documentTypes": {
              "driving_licence": {
                "country": null
              },
              "passport": true,
              "national_identity_card": true
            }
          }
        },
        "complete"
      ]
    }
    ```

  - `showCountrySelection` (boolean - default: `false`)

    **Note**: Support for the `showCountrySelection` option will be deprecated soon in favour of the per document country configuration detailed above which offers integrators better control.

    The `showCountrySelection` option controls what happens when **only a single document** is preselected in `documentTypes` It has no effect when the SDK has been set up with multiple documents preselected.

    The country selection screen is never displayed for a passport document.

    By default, if only one document type is preselected, and the document type is not `passport`, the country selection screen will not be displayed. If you would like to have this screen displayed still, set `showCountrySelection` to `true`.

    ```javascript
    options: {
      documentTypes: {
        passport: boolean,
        driving_licence: boolean,
        national_identity_card: boolean,
        residence_permit: boolean
      },
      showCountrySelection: boolean (note that this will only apply for certain scenarios, see example configurations below)
    }
    ```

    #### Example of Document step without Country Selection screen for a preselected non-passport document (default behaviour)

    ```json
    {
      "steps": [
        "welcome",
        {
          "type": "document",
          "options": {
            "documentTypes": {
              // Note that only 1 document type is selected here
              "passport": false,
              "driving_licence": false,
              "national_identity_card": true
            },
            "showCountrySelection": false
          }
        },
        "complete"
      ]
    }
    ```

    #### Examples of Document step configuration with more than one preselected documents where Country Selection will still be displayed

    **Example 1**
    All document type options enabled, `"showCountrySelection": false` has no effect

    ```json
    {
      "steps": [
        "welcome",
        {
          "type": "document",
          "options": {
            "documentTypes": {
              "passport": true,
              "driving_licence": true,
              "national_identity_card": true
            },
            "showCountrySelection": false (NOTE: has no effect)
          }
        },
        "complete"
      ]
    }
    ```

    **Example 2**
    2 document type options enabled, `"showCountrySelection": false` has no effect

    ```json
    {
      "steps": [
        "welcome",
        {
          "type": "document",
          "options": {
            "documentTypes": {
              "passport": true,
              "national_identity_card": true,
              "driving_licence": false
            },
            "showCountrySelection": false (NOTE: has no effect)
          }
        },
        "complete"
      ]
    }
    ```

  - `forceCrossDevice` (boolean - default: `false`)

    When set to `true`, desktop users will be forced to use their mobile devices to capture the document image. They will be able to do so via the built-in SMS feature. Use this option if you want to prevent file upload from desktops.

    ```javascript
    options: {
      forceCrossDevice: true
    }
    ```

  - `useLiveDocumentCapture` (boolean - default: `false`)
    **This BETA feature is only available on mobile devices.**

    When set to `true`, users on mobile browsers with camera support will be able to capture document images using an optimised camera UI, where the SDK directly controls the camera feed to ensure live capture. For unsupported scenarios, see the `uploadFallback` section below.
    Tested on: Android Chrome `78.0.3904.108`, iOS Safari `13`

  - `uploadFallback` (boolean - default: `true`)
    Only available when `useLiveDocumentCapture` is enabled.

    When `useLiveDocumentCapture` is set to `true`, the SDK will attempt to open an optimised camera UI for the user to take a live photo of the selected document. When this is not possible (because of an unsupported browser or mobile devices with no camera), by default the user will be presented with an HTML5 File Input upload because of `uploadFallback`. In this scenario, they will be able to use their mobile device's default camera application to take a photo, but will not be presented with an optimised camera UI.

    This method does not guarantee live capture, because certain mobile device browsers and camera applications may also allow uploads from the user's gallery of photos.

    **Warning**: If the mobile device does not have a camera or there is no camera browser support, and `uploadFallback` is set to `false`, the user will not be able to complete the flow.

    ```javascript
    options: {
      useLiveDocumentCapture: true,
      uploadFallback: false
    }
    ```

  ### poa

  This is the Proof of Address capture step. Users will be asked to select the document type and to provide images of their selected document. They will also have a chance to check the quality of the images before confirming.
  The custom options are:

  - `country` (default: `GBR`)
  - `documentTypes`

  ```javascript
  options: {
    country: string,
    documentTypes: {
      bank_building_society_statement: boolean,
      utility_bill: boolean,
      council_tax: boolean, // GBR only
      benefit_letters: boolean, // GBR only
      government_letter: boolean // non-GBR only
    }
  }
  ```

  **The Proof of Address document capture is currently a BETA feature, and it cannot be used in conjunction with the document and face steps as part of a single SDK flow.**

  ### face

  This is the face capture step. Users will be asked to capture their face in the form of a photo or a video. They will also have a chance to check the quality of the photos or video before confirming.

  The custom options are:

  - `requestedVariant` (string)

    A preferred variant can be requested for this step, by passing the option `requestedVariant: 'standard' | 'video'`. If empty, it will default to `standard` and a photo will be captured. If the `requestedVariant` is `video`, we will try to fulfil this request depending on camera availability and device/browser support. In case a video cannot be taken the face step will fallback to the `standard` option. At the end of the flow, the `onComplete` callback will return the `variant` used to capture face and this can be used to initiate a `facial_similarity_photo` or a `facial_similarity_video` check.

  - `uploadFallback` (boolean - default: `true`)

    By default, the SDK will attempt to open an optimised camera UI for the user to take a live photo/video. When this is not possible (because of an unsupported browser or mobile devices with no camera), by default the user will be presented with an HTML5 File Input upload because of `uploadFallback`. In this scenario, they will be able to use their mobile device's default camera application to take a photo, but will not be presented with an optimised camera UI.

    This method does not guarantee live capture, because certain mobile device browsers and camera applications may also allow uploads from the user's gallery of photos.

    **Warning**: If the mobile device does not have a camera or there is no camera browser support, and `uploadFallback` is set to `false`, the user will not be able to complete the flow.

    ```javascript
    options: {
      requestedVariant: 'standard' | 'video',
      uploadFallback: false
    }
    ```

  - `useMultipleSelfieCapture` (boolean - default: `true`)

    When enabled, this feature allows the SDK to take additional selfie snapshots to help improve face similarity check accuracy. When disabled, only one selfie photo will be taken.

  ### complete

  This is the final completion step. You can use this to inform your users what is happening next. The custom options are:

  - `message` (string)
  - `submessage` (string)

### Changing options in runtime

It's possible to change the options initialised at runtime:

```javascript
onfidoOut = Onfido.init({...})
...
//Change the title of the welcome screen
onfidoOut.setOptions({
  steps: [
    {
      type:'welcome',
      options:{title:"New title!"}
    },
    'document',
    'face',
    'complete'
  ]
});
...
//replace the jwt token
onfidoOut.setOptions({ token:"new token" });
...
//Open the modal
onfidoOut.setOptions({ isModalOpen:true });
```

The new options will be shallowly merged with the previous one. So one can pass only the differences to a get a new flow.

## Creating checks

This SDK’s aim is to help with the document capture process. It does not actually perform the full document/face checks against our [API](https://documentation.onfido.com/).

In order to perform a full document/face check, you need to call our [API](https://documentation.onfido.com/) to create a check for the applicant on your backend.

### 1. Creating a check

With your API token and applicant id (see [Getting started](#getting-started)), you will need to create a check by making a request to the [create check endpoint](https://documentation.onfido.com/#create-check). If you are just verifying a document, you only have to include a [document report](https://documentation.onfido.com/#document-report) as part of the check. On the other hand, if you are verifying a document and a face photo/video, you will also have to include a [facial similarity report](https://documentation.onfido.com/#facial-similarity-reports).
The facial similarity check can be performed in two different variants: `facial_similarity_photo` and `facial_similarity_video`. If the SDK is initialised with the `requestedVariant` option for the face step, make sure you use the data returned in the `onComplete` callback to request the right report.
The value of `variant` indicates whether a photo or video was captured and it needs to be used to determine the report name you should include in your request.
Example of data returned by the `onComplete` callback:
`{face: {variant: 'standard' | 'video'}}`

When the `variant` returned is `standard`, you should include `facial_similarity_photo` in the `report_names` array.
If the `variant` returned is `video`, you should include `facial_similarity_video` in the `report_names` array.

```shell
$ curl https://api.onfido.com/v3/checks \
    -H 'Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_TOKEN' \
    -d '{
      "applicant_id": "<APPLICANT_ID>",
      "report_names": ["document", "facial_similarity_photo" | "facial_similarity_video"]
    }'
```

Note: If you are currently using API `v2` please refer to [this migration guide](https://developers.onfido.com/guide/api-v2-to-v3-migration-guide) for more information.

You will receive a response containing the check id instantly. As document and facial similarity reports do not always return actual [results](https://documentation.onfido.com/#results) straightaway, you need to set up a webhook to get notified when the results are ready.

Finally, as you are testing with the sandbox token, please be aware that the results are pre-determined. You can learn more about sandbox responses [here](https://documentation.onfido.com/#pre-determined-responses).

### 2. Setting up webhooks

Refer to the [Webhooks](https://documentation.onfido.com/#webhooks) section in the API documentation for details.

## User Analytics

The SDK allows you to track the user's journey through the verification process via a dispatched event. This is meant to give some insight into how your user's make use of the SDK screens.

### Overriding the hook

In order to expose the user's progress through the SDK an `EventListener` must be added that listens for `UserAnalyticsEvent` events. This can be done anywhere within your application and might look something like the following:

```javascript
addEventListener('userAnalyticsEvent', (event) => /*Your code here*/);
```

The code inside of the `EventListener` will now be called when a particular event is triggered, usually when the user reaches a new screen. For a full list of events see the bottom of this section.

The parameter being passed in is an `Event` object, the details related to the user analytics event can be found at the path `event.detail` and are as follows:

- `eventName`: A `String` indicating the type of event. Currently will always this return as `"Screen"` as each tracked event is a user visiting a screen. In the future more event types may become available for tracking.
- `properties`: A `Map` object containing the specific details of an event. This will contain things such as the `name` of the screen visited.

### Using the data

Currently we recommend using the above hook to keep track of how many user's reach each screen in your flow. This can be done by storing the count of users that reach each screen and comparing them to the amount of user's who've made it to the `Welcome` screen.

### Tracked events

Below is the list of potential events currently being tracked by the hook:

```
WELCOME - User reached the "Welcome" screen
DOCUMENT_TYPE_SELECT - User reached the "Choose document" screen where the type of document to upload can be selected
ID_DOCUMENT_COUNTRY_SELECT - User reached the "Select issuing country" screen where the the appropriate issuing country can be searched for and selected if supported
CROSS_DEVICE_START - User reached the "document capture" screen on mobile after visiting the cross-device link
DOCUMENT_CAPTURE_FRONT - User reached the "document capture" screen for the front side (for one-sided or two-sided document)
DOCUMENT_CAPTURE_BACK - User reached the "document capture" screen for the back side (for two-sided document)
DOCUMENT_CAPTURE_CONFIRMATION_FRONT - User reached the "document confirmation" screen for the front side (for one-sided or two-sided document)
DOCUMENT_CAPTURE_CONFIRMATION_BACK - User reached the "document confirmation" screen for the back side (for two-sided document)
FACIAL_INTRO - User reached the "selfie intro" screen
FACIAL_CAPTURE - User reached the "selfie capture" screen
FACIAL_CAPTURE_CONFIRMATION - User reached the "selfie confirmation" screen
VIDEO_FACIAL_INTRO - User reached the "liveness intro" screen
VIDEO_FACIAL_CAPTURE_STEP_1 - User reached the 1st challenge during "liveness video capture", challenge_type can be found in eventProperties
VIDEO_FACIAL_CAPTURE_STEP_2 - User reached the 2nd challenge during "liveness video capture", challenge_type can be found in eventProperties
UPLOAD - User's file is uploading
```

## Going live

Once you are happy with your integration and are ready to go live, please contact [client-support@onfido.com](mailto:client-support@onfido.com) to obtain live version of the API token. We will have to replace the sandbox token in your code with the live token.

A few things to check before you go live:

- Make sure you have set up webhooks to receive live events
- Make sure you have entered correct billing details inside your [Onfido Dashboard](https://onfido.com/dashboard/)

## Accessibility

The Onfido SDK has been optimised to provide the following accessibility support by default:

- Screen reader support: accessible labels for textual and non-textual elements available to aid screen reader navigation, including dynamic alerts
- Keyboard navigation: all interactive elements are reachable using a keyboard
- Sufficient color contrast: default colors have been tested to meet the recommended level of contrast
- Sufficient touch target size: all interactive elements have been designed to meet the recommended touch target size

Refer to our [accessibility statement](https://developers.onfido.com/guide/sdk-accessibility-statement) for more details.

### Troubleshooting

#### Content Security Policy issues

In order to mitigate potential cross-site scripting issues, most modern browsers use Content Security Policy (CSP). These policies might prevent the SDK from correctly displaying the images captured during the flow or to correctly load styles. If CSP is blocking some of the SDK functionalities, make sure you add the following snippet inside the `<head>` tag of your application.

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="
  default-src 'self' https://assets.onfido.com;
  script-src 'self' https://www.woopra.com https://assets.onfido.com https://sentry.io;
  style-src 'self' https://assets.onfido.com;
  connect-src blob: *.onfido.com wss://*.onfido.com https://www.woopra.com https://sentry.io;
  img-src 'self' data: blob: https://lipis.github.io/flag-icon-css/;
  media-src blob:;
  object-src 'self' blob:;
  frame-src 'self' data: blob:;
"
/>
```

#### SDK navigation issues

In rare cases, the SDK back button might not work as expected within the application history. This is due to the interaction of `history/createBrowserHistory` with the browser history API.
If you notice that by clicking on the SDK back button, you get redirected to the page that preceeded the SDK initialisation, you might want to consider using the following configuration option when initialising the SDK: `useMemoryHistory: true`. This option allows the SDK to use the `history/createMemoryHistory` function, instead of the default `history/createBrowserHistory`. This option is intended as workaround, while a more permanent fix is implemented.

Example:

```javascript
Onfido.init({
  useMemoryHistory: true,
})
```
