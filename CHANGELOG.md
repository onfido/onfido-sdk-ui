## [Next-version]

### Added
- Public: Added `isCrossDevice` flag to user analytics events to differentiate between cross-device and non-cross-device user analytic events
- Public: Added `DOCUMENT_TYPE_SELECT` and `FACIAL_CAPTURE` to user analytics event list

## [5.12.0] - 2020-07-08

### Added
- Public: Added new enterprise feature `cobrand`. This allows integrators with access to the feature to display a co-branded footer with their company name, followed by "powered by Onfido" on all screens, including cross-device. Note that this will not be displayed if the `hideOnfidoLogo` enterprise feature is also enabled.
- Internal: Added bundle size limit check for `dist/style.css`.
- Public: Fix empty file sometimes being sent to /snapshots endpoint on some browsers when `useMultipleSelfieCapture` is enabled. This results in user seeing a "Unsupported File" error on Selfie upload.

### Added
- Public: Added check for cross_device_url in SDK Token to be used as the link for all cross device options instead of the default HOSTED_SDK_URL, if present. cross_device_url is an enterprise feature and can only be set when creating a SDK token if the feature is enabled.

- UI: Added passport quality guide before upload/capture.

### Changed
- Public: Use `history/createBrowserHistory` as the default option to manage the SDK history.

- Internal: Fix a bug that potentially allowed 3rd party tracking scripts to (in some very specific conditions) continue to send Onfido tracking events, after calling `.tearDown()`
- Public: Users could previously see a flicker of other screens when loading any flow involving the camera. This should now no longer occur, except in rare circumstances (where permissions/capabilities have changed since last render)

### Added
- Public: Introduced ability to capture videos on the face step. Developers can now request a preferred variant for the face step, by adding the option `requestedVariant: 'standard' | 'video'`. If empty, it will default to `standard` and a photo will be captured. If the `requestedVariant` is `video`, we will try to fulfil this request depending on camera availability and device/browser support. In case a video cannot be taken the face step will fallback to the `standard` option. At the end of the flow, the `onComplete` callback will return the `variant` used to capture face and this can be used to initiate the facial_similarity check.

### Changed
- Public: The `onComplete` callback now returns an object including the `variant` used for the capture step. The variant can be used to initiate the facial_similarity check. Data returned: `{face: {variant: 'standard' | 'video'}}`.
- UI: Selfie UI to adopt full container layout on desktop.

- Public: Captures are now returned as `png` instead of `webp`, although `webp` is still used internally for streaming to the server.
- Public: the captures returned by `Onfido.getCaptures()` have a simplified signature of just `{id,image,documentType}`.
- Public: It's now possible to open and close the modal by calling `.setOptions({isModalOpen:boolean})`
- Internal: The modal has been refactored to be fully reactive, `vanilla-modal` has been replaced with a fork of `react-modal`.
- Internal: Updated to `onfido-sdk-core@0.6.0`, selectors are now more general as in they are no longer specific to each capture type, some new selectors are also being used.
- Internal: `Camera`, `Capture` and `Uploader` have been refactored, the pure part of the components have been separated from the state logic part. This adds flexibility and encapsulation.
- Internal: The `Capture` component now orchestrates all the state logic of the `Uploader` component, this allows to join the camera and uploader state logic together.

### Added
- Public: The capture screen UI now includes an upload button fallback, for whenever the user experiences problems with the webcam.
- Internal: When requesting to validate documents there is now a strategy to cope with slow responses from the server. If the number of unprocessed documents is 3+, the client stops sending more requests until a response is given.
- Internal: `webp` falls back to `jpeg` in case the browser does not support it.

## [0.7.0]

### Changed
- Public: `onComplete` event now fires only after both the document and face captures have been confirmed in the UI
- Internal: updated `onfido-sdk-core` to 0.5.0 which causes the all capture event to be triggered when captured are both valid and confirmed
- Internal: made the confirm button change the state of the capture to confirmed

### Fixed
- Internal: sometimes when document was retaken multiple times the capture ended up squashed. This was fixed by upgrading to `react-webcam@0.0.14`.
- Internal: fixed [Bug #36](https://github.com/onfido/onfido-sdk-ui/issues/36), it caused the face to be captured every second after a document retake.

## [0.6.1]

### Changed
- Public: `Onfido.init()` now returns an object.
- Internal: `isDesktop` detection is now based on [DetectRTC][detectrtc]'s `isMobile` detection
- Internal: improved Webcam Detection, it now takes into account wether a Webcam exists and if it the user has given the website permission to use it. Before it was only checking whether the **getUserMedia** API is supported by the browser or not. [DetectRTC][detectrtc] is used for this detection.

### Added
- Public: it's now possible to change the init options at runtime by calling `setOptions()` on the object returned by `Onfido.init()`
- Public: `useWebcam` option added to the facial and document capture step

## [0.5.1]
### Fix
- SDK Core dependency update, fixes issue https://github.com/onfido/onfido-sdk-ui/issues/25

## [0.5.0]
### Added
- API: Flow customization option `steps:[]`
- UI: Overlay to the webcam document capture (**Possibly breaking change**)
- DOC: Integration examples to documentation
### Fixed
- NPM (commonjs2) style of importing the library now works
