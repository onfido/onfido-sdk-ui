### Changed
- Public: ES style import interface has been changed to a more standard one

- Internal: Upgraded to webpack 4, removed import/export transpilation. Reduced bundle size as result.

### Fixed
- Public: Users entering the cross-device flow twice would have been able to request an SMS message without re-entering their mobile number correctly (the form could submit when still blank)
- Internal: Fix a bug that potentially allowed 3rd party tracking scripts to (in some very specific conditions) continue to send Onfido tracking events, after calling `.tearDown()`
- Public: Users could previously see a flicker of other screens when loading any flow involving the camera. This should now no longer occur, except in rare circumstances (where permissions/capabilities have changed since last render)
- Public: Workaround an iOS Safari issue that causes a possible browser crash when mounting the webcam component multiple times

## [3.1.0] - 2019-01-28

- Internal: Further device metadata submitted to Onfido API
- Internal: Upload fallback for the `face` step can be disabled by using the option `{ uploadFallback: false }`. The default value is `true`
- Internal: Added multi-frame capture for the `standard` variant of the face step (only for camera capture).


### Changed

- Internal: Removed unused development dependencies which had known vulnerabilities


## [3.0.1] - 2018-12-19

### Fixed
- Internal: Fixed an infinite loading loop that happened when video liveness is enabled and if, and only if, users transitioned from a desktop browser that support video liveness to a mobile browser that does not support video liveness


## [3.0.0] - 2018-10-31

### Added
- Internal: Introduce Jest unit testing framework
- Public: Added support for default SMS number country code. The default country for the SMS number input can be customised by passing the `smsNumberCountryCode` option when the SDK is initialised. The value should be a 2-characters long ISO Country code string. If empty, the SMS number country code will default to `GB`.
- UI: UI improvements including adding back icon with hover state and icon to close the modal

### Changed

## [2.7.0] - 2018-09-03

### Added
- Public: Introduced ability to capture videos on the face step. Developers can now request a preferred variant for the face step, by adding the option `requestedVariant: 'standard' | 'video'`. If empty, it will default to `standard` and a photo will be captured. If the `requestedVariant` is `video`, we will try to fulfil this request depending on camera availability and device/browser support. In case a video cannot be taken the face step will fallback to the `standard` option. At the end of the flow, the `onComplete` callback will return the `variant` used to capture face and this can be used to initiate the facial_similarity check.

### Changed
- Public: The `onComplete` callback now returns an object including the `variant` used for the capture step. The variant can be used to initiate the facial_similarity check. Data returned: `{face: {variant: 'standard' | 'video'}}`.
- UI: Selfie UI to adopt full container layout on desktop.
- Internal: CSS namespacing now includes the full path of the component, to mitigate chances of name collision. Only impacts components nested in another component folder.


## [2.6.0] - 2018-08-08

### Added
- Public: Uploaded PDF files are now supported and returned by the callbacks as base64.
- Internal: PDF files are displayed in the confirmation step as an embedded object, which means the browser needs to support pdf files in order for them to be visible.

## [0.9.0]

### Changed
- Public: document and face callback are now passed only their respective capture, instead of both their captures.
- Public: document and face callback are now only called after the user has confirmed the capture
- Public: document, face and complete callback can be called multiple times, if the condition that triggers them is met more than once (eg. if the user goes back to redo the capture steps)
- Internal: callbacks' returned value now have no impact on the event dispatcher.

### Fixed
- All captures have now a default no op function. This fixes an exception raise (in case some callbacks where not defined), which caused the rest of the callbacks not to be called after the exception was raised.

## [0.8.4]

### Fixed
- Updated `react-webcam` to the onfido fork, this fixes the issue where the webcam canvas (used to obtain screenshots) has 0 height under certain circumstances (namely on windows machines running Chrome). This bug, when it happened, caused the document capture step not to work.

## [0.8.3]

### Added

- UI disappeared if the browser's windows width was smaller than 481px;

## [0.8.0]

### Changed
- Public: Captures are now returned as `png` instead of `webp`, although `webp` is still used internally for streaming to the server.
- Public: the captures returned by `Onfido.getCaptures()` have a simplified signature of just `{id,image,documentType}`.
- Public: It's now possible to open and close the modal by calling `.setOptions({isModalOpen:boolean})`
- Internal: The modal has been refactored to be fully reactive, `vanilla-modal` has been replaced with a fork of `react-modal`.
- Internal: Updated to `onfido-sdk-core@0.6.0`, selectors are now more general as in they are no longer specific to each capture type, some new selectors are also being used.
- Internal: `Camera`, `Capture` and `Uploader` have been refactored, the pure part of the components have been separated from the state logic part. This adds flexibility and encapsulation.
- Internal: The `Capture` component now orchestrates all the state logic of the `Uploader` component, this allows to join the camera and uploader state logic together.

### Added
- Public: The capture screen UI now includes an upload button fallback, for whenever the user experiences problems with the webcam.
- Internal: When requesting to validate documents there is now a strategy to cope with slow responses from the server. If the number of unprocessed documents is 3+, the client stops sending more requests until a response is given.
- Internal: `webp` falls back to `jpeg` in case the browser does not support it.


## [0.7.0]

### Changed
- Public: `onComplete` event now fires only after both the document and face captures have been confirmed in the UI
- Internal: updated `onfido-sdk-core` to 0.5.0 which causes the all capture event to be triggered when captured are both valid and confirmed
- Internal: made the confirm button change the state of the capture to confirmed

### Fixed
- Internal: sometimes when document was retaken multiple times the capture ended up squashed. This was fixed by upgrading to `react-webcam@0.0.14`.
- Internal: fixed [Bug #36](https://github.com/onfido/onfido-sdk-ui/issues/36), it caused the face to be captured every second after a document retake.


## [0.6.1]

### Changed
- Public: `Onfido.init()` now returns an object.
- Internal: `isDesktop` detection is now based on [DetectRTC][detectrtc]'s `isMobile` detection
- Internal: improved Webcam Detection, it now takes into account wether a Webcam exists and if it the user has given the website permission to use it. Before it was only checking whether the **getUserMedia** API is supported by the browser or not. [DetectRTC][detectrtc] is used for this detection.

### Added
- Public: it's now possible to change the init options at runtime by calling `setOptions()` on the object returned by `Onfido.init()`
- Public: `useWebcam` option added to the facial and document capture step

## [0.5.1]
### Fix
- SDK Core dependency update, fixes issue https://github.com/onfido/onfido-sdk-ui/issues/25

- UI: Overlay to the webcam document capture (**Possibly breaking change**)
- DOC: Integration examples to documentation
