Necessary to polyfill Promise due to webpack dynamic import using it
see: https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#import-

#HACK it's a hack because webpack should allow to just import Promise instead of consuming it from global.
We import core-js promise since it's the one used by babel runtime.
This way we avoid duplicate Promise implementation.

Discussion: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/3531

Using this particular module, since it seems to be the one used by babel-runtime,
which means we are reusing code as much as possible.
