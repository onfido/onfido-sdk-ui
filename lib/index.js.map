However, since it's an all or nothing deal,\neven if you use supported methods, babel runtime will still import the whole module.\n\nThe reason for this is probably because core-js only has one big module for URL.\n\nIn the end, in order to avoid the runtime to import the whole corejs URL module\nunecessarly for the ObjectURL methods, which are supported by IE11,\nthis module was created. Which as different babelrc that does not have the runtime.\nThis way the URL module does not get imported and the bundle does not get bloated.\n*/\nexport const createObjectURL = URL.createObjectURL\nexport const revokeObjectURL = URL.revokeObjectURL\n","import { h, Component } from 'preact'\nimport { blobToLossyBase64 } from '~utils/blob'\nimport { createObjectURL, revokeObjectURL } from '~utils/objectUrl'\n\nexport const withBlobPreviewUrl = (WrappedComponent) =>\n  class BlobPreviewUrlComponent extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n      super(props)\n      const { blob } = props\n      this.state = {\n        previewUrl: this.createPreviewUrl(blob),\n      }\n    }\n\n    createPreviewUrl = (blob) => (blob ? createObjectURL(blob) : null)\n\n    updateBlobPreview(blob) {\n      this.revokePreviewURL()\n      this.setState({ previewUrl: this.createPreviewUrl(blob) })\n    }\n\n    revokePreviewURL() {\n      revokeObjectURL(this.state.previewUrl)\n    }\n\n    componentWillReceiveProps({ blob }) {\n      if (this.props.blob !== blob) this.updateBlobPreview(blob)\n    }\n\n    componentWillUnmount() {\n      this.revokePreviewURL()\n    }\n\n    render() {\n      return (\n        <WrappedComponent previewUrl={this.state.previewUrl} {...this.props} />\n      )\n    }\n  }\n\nexport const withBlobBase64 = (WrappedComponent) =>\n  class BlobBase64Component extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n      super(props)\n      const { blob } = props\n      this.state = {\n        base64: null,\n      }\n      this.updateBase64(blob)\n    }\n\n    updateBase64(blob) {\n      blob &&\n        blobToLossyBase64(\n          blob,\n          (base64) => this.setState({ base64 }),\n          () => console.error('An error occurred converting a blob to base64')\n        )\n    }\n\n    componentWillReceiveProps({ blob }) {\n      if (this.props.blob !== blob) this.updateBase64(blob)\n    }\n\n    render() {\n      // don't show anything while we're loading the first base64 image\n      if (!this.state.base64) return null\n      return <WrappedComponent base64={this.state.base64} {...this.props} />\n    }\n  }\n","import { h, Component } from 'preact'\nimport PDFObject from 'pdfobject'\nimport { preventDefaultOnClick } from '~utils'\nimport { withBlobPreviewUrl } from './hocs'\nimport style from './style.scss'\n\nconst IEPdfBlobLink = ({ blob }) => {\n  // Object urls created from Blobs don't work on IE11 and Edge, so we use this component as a fallback\n  // Without this component PDFObject would display an error instead of the expected PDFObject link fallback.\n  const downloadPDF = () => {\n    window.navigator.msSaveOrOpenBlob(blob, 'document.pdf')\n  }\n  return (\n    <a\n      href=\"#\"\n      onClick={preventDefaultOnClick(downloadPDF)}\n      className={style.pdfIcon}\n    />\n  )\n}\n\nlet i = 0\n\nclass PDFPreview extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.id = `pdfContainer${i++}`\n  }\n  options = {\n    width: '100%',\n    height: `${290 / 16}em`, // aiming for 290px, assuming an 1em size of 16px\n    'max-height': '70vh',\n    border: 0,\n    fallbackLink: `<a href='[url]' class=${style.pdfIcon} download/>`,\n  }\n\n  embedPDF(previewUrl) {\n    PDFObject.embed(previewUrl, `#${this.id}`, this.options)\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    const { previewUrl } = this.props\n    this.embedPDF(previewUrl)\n  }\n  shouldComponentUpdate() {\n    return false\n  }\n  componentWillReceiveProps({ previewUrl }) {\n    if (this.props.pdfPreview !== previewUrl) this.embedPDF(previewUrl)\n  }\n  render() {\n    return <div id={this.id} />\n  }\n}\n\nconst PDFPreviewWithPreviewUrl = withBlobPreviewUrl(PDFPreview)\n\nclass PdfViewer extends Component {\n  shouldComponentUpdate() {\n    return false\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { blob } = this.props\n    return (\n      <div className={style.pdfWrapper}>\n        {window.navigator.msSaveOrOpenBlob ?
