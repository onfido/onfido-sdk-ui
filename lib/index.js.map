However, since it's an all or nothing deal,\neven if you use supported methods, babel runtime will still import the whole module.\n\nThe reason for this is probably because core-js only has one big module for URL.\n\nIn the end, in order to avoid the runtime to import the whole corejs URL module\nunecessarly for the ObjectURL methods, which are supported by IE11,\nthis module was created. Which as different babelrc that does not have the runtime.\nThis way the URL module does not get imported and the bundle does not get bloated.\n*/\nexport const createObjectURL = URL.createObjectURL\nexport const revokeObjectURL = URL.revokeObjectURL\n","import { h, Component, ComponentType } from 'preact'\nimport { blobToLossyBase64 } from '~utils/blob'\nimport { createObjectURL, revokeObjectURL } from '~utils/objectUrl'\n\nimport type { WithBlobPreviewProps } from '~types/hocs'\n\ntype WrappedPreviewProps = {\n  base64?: string\n  previewUrl?: string\n}\n\nexport const withBlobPreviewUrl = <P extends WrappedPreviewProps>(\n  WrappedComponent: ComponentType<P>\n): ComponentType<P & WithBlobPreviewProps> => {\n  type State = {\n    previewUrl?: string\n  }\n\n  class BlobPreviewUrlComponent extends Component<\n    P & WithBlobPreviewProps,\n    State\n  > {\n    constructor(props: P & WithBlobPreviewProps) {\n      super(props)\n\n      const { blob } = props\n\n      this.state = {\n        previewUrl: this.createPreviewUrl(blob),\n      }\n    }\n\n    createPreviewUrl = (blob?: Blob) =>\n      blob ?
